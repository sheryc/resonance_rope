# Disclaimer

This is a fork of [YaRN](https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn), with Resonance YaRN added to the repo. Currently, we only tested Resonance YaRN's performance on LLaMA2-Chat models due to restrictions of hardware resources. To apply Resonance to any position encodings used in this repo, simply add ``--resonance-rope`` to your fine-tuning command. As an example:

```python
accelerate launch finetune.py \
    --output-dir output/resonance-yarn-7b-32k \
    --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf \
    --scaling-factor 8 \
    --truncate 32768 \
    --max-train-steps 50 \
    --warmup-steps 2 \
    --architecture llama \
    --deepspeed \
    --resonance-rope
```

We provide this training script in ``train.sh``. For setting up the environments, please follow the instructions below provided by the authors of YaRN.


# YaRN

## Models

### LLaMA

We publish 7B and 13B variants of [Llama 2](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/) fine-tuned with YaRN at 64K and 128K context window length.
They are available under the Llama 2 license on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face.

| Size | Context | Link   |
| ---: | ------: | :----- |
|   7B |     64K | [NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-7b-64k](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-7b-64k)     |
|   7B |    128K | [NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-7b-128k](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-7b-128k)   |

|  13B |    128K | [NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-13b-128k](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Yarn-Llama-2-13b-128k) |

In addition, we also publish 8K context window versions of Llama 2 7B fine-tuned with [NTK-aware](https://huggingface.co/emozilla/NTK-Llama-2-7b-8k) and [YaRN](https://huggingface.co/emozilla/Yarn-Llama-2-7b-8k) (Table 1 in the conference paper).

### Mistral

With the release of v2 of our paper we are also publishing 64K and 128K variants of [Mistral 7B v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1).

| Size | Context | Link   |
| ---: | ------: | :----- |
|   7B |     64K | [NousResearch/Yarn-Mistral-7b-64k](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Yarn-Mistral-7b-64k)     |
|   7B |    128K | [NousResearch/Yarn-Mistral-7b-128k](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Yarn-Mistral-7b-128k)   |

## Reproduction

We strongly believe in open science, and thus publish all code and data to reproduce the results in our paper.
To reproduce, clone the repository and perform a local installation.

```python
git clone https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn
cd yarn
pip install -e .
```

### Training

To train the models, run `accelerate config` and enable DeepSpeed acceleration. `deepspeed/zero3.json` was the configuration file used for training.

```sh
# ./train.sh
```

The tokenized training data is available on [ðŸ¤—Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emozilla/pg_books-tokenized-bos-eos-chunked-65536) and was derived from the [pg19](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emozilla/pg19) dataset.
For the Mistral models, a mix of the pretrain and fine-tune splits of [Long-Data-Collections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/Long-Data-Collections) was used and the tokenized dataset is also available on [ðŸ¤—Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emozilla/yarn-train-tokenized-16k-mistral).

### Evaluation

To reproduce the evaluations, install [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) with `pip install git+https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness` and then run the two provided scripts.

```sh
# ./eval.sh
# ./eval-harness.sh
```
